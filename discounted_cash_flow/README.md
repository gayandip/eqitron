# Discounted Cash flow Calculation (DCF)
calculate the intrinsic value of a company
<br><hr>
DCF is a method to find the approximate intrinsic value of a company based on future assumption. We discount the future cash flow(s) to now, and extra we take a terminal value which we will get a big number, all the numbers will be discontinued to today.
<br><hr>
First it needs the current total free cash flow or the owner earnings, and the expected CAGR growth for future and the time frame (years), for which time you want to calculate
<br><br>
Next the expected CAGR return rate or the discount rate, the rate of return which you want to discount all the cash flow. And now the most important terminal value, as this is mostly focused on secondary market stocks, so we can get exit from the business. That's why we are using here a expected cash flow multiple for exit.
<br><br>
Then the current profit and the current eps is for calculation of per share price, if you want the whole entity value make both the cells 1, else enter the total profit and the EPS, for better result use the current quarter profit and EPS
<br><hr>
Disclaimer : DCF is a assumption based calculation, so never be too much optimistic, and always calculate your margin of safety.
