# Dividend Reinvestment Calculation
calculate the total reinvested dividend value
<br><hr>
First it needs the current portfolio value or the lumpsum money you are investing now, and also the SIP per month you are doing. If you are not continuing any SIP leave it 0 or if you dont have lumpsum value or current portfolio make the upper cell 0
<br><br>
Next the expected CAGR growth rate, it will be applied both on the lumpsum, SIP and in the reinvestment calculation. And now enter the time horizon you are looking for. And lastly the expected dividend yield, it will be applied both on the SIP and the lumpsum
<br><br>
Now some of you may ask that how the dividend amount is so high. Actually the assumptions are, that you will get the dividend amount through the whole year and in the next year you will invest the amount and next year you will again get dividend and invest it but the dividend amount you have invested last year that also will give you some extra dividend. And also don't forget the SIP that also will generate dividend. So investing the dividend and generating dividend from dividend and growing the dividend is giving the big number.

Disclaimer : All the calculations are linear in nature, but market doesn't work in a linear way. So don't be surprised if the actual amount comes greater or less then the calculation.
