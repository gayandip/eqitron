New freedom calculator
<br><hr>
calculate the total investment or sip amount needed for achieving the freedom corpus.
<br><hr>
First it needs the monthly expense and the inflation rate over the years you want to calculate. Next the withdrawal yield is the amount you will withdraw after the corpus is being made. Now the current portfolio or the investment size and the sip per month amount and the most important expected growth rate for the years you want to calculate and the current expected dividend yield.
<br>
It will show the corpus value and the extra investment needed amount.
<br>
Now some of you may ask that how the dividend amount is so high. Actually the assumptions are that you will get the dividend amount through the whole year and in the next year you will invest the amount and next year you will again get dividend and invest it but the dividend amount you have invested that also will give you some extra dividend. And also don't forget the sip that also will generate dividend. So investing the dividend and generating dividend from dividend and growing the dividend is giving the big number.
<br>
Now if you say that's not possible then just think that the sip amount is calculated fixed but it is not practically possible, as you earn more you will invest more, so that amount will compensate all the errors in assumption like inflation, dividend, some part of growth etc.
